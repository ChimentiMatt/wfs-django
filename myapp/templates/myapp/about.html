              The audience includes a large portion of senior citizens and is
              drawn mostly from the surrounding area, including Gladstone,

            <p class="AboutTexts">
              A number of conductors tout themselves as "philosophers of the
              podium", but Mark Perlman really is one - besides his long
              experience as a conductor, he also has a Ph.D. in philosophy from
              the University of Arizona, and is Professor of Philosophy at
              Western Oregon University.
            </p>
            <p class="AboutTexts">
              Dr. Perlman teaches classes in Philosophy of Music and Philosophy
              of Art (as well as many other areas in philosophy), and has
              numerous published writings in philosophy. His educational
              background, technical expertise, and performance experience in
              both classical music and jazz have enabled Dr. Perlman to bring a
              broad range of qualifications to conducting.

            <p class="AboutTexts">
              He began in music playing guitar and singing, and at thirteen
              moved on to string bass, following in the footsteps of his father,
              David Perlman, who was Principal Bass with the Cleveland
              Orchestra. He began studying conducting in college, but was known
              even in his teenage years to use a chop stick baton to conduct in
              front of the stereo. He actually made his conducting debut with
              his Junior High School orchestra conducting the Bach Brandenburg
              Concerto No. 3. During college, he studied in Munich, Germany for
              a year, and traveled Europe to hear every major European
              orchestra, and over the years he has become an expert in
              historical orchestral recordings. The result is an unusual depth
              of perception and insight. His flair for presentation was
              definitely illustrated in a series of educational radio broadcasts
              he made in Scottsdale, Arizona as well as in his work as an
              announcer for a weekly classical radio show in Ohio early in his
              career.

            <p class="AboutTexts">Willamette Falls Symphony started in 1981 as the Clackamas Community Orchestra with eight members.  The orchestra moved to Barclay School where it was sponsored by Oregon City Community Schools.  Since 2004 Willamette Falls Symphony plays in the United Methodist Church and has expanded to over fifty players.</p>
            <p class="AboutTexts">In 1993 the orchestra received its first grant from the Regional Arts and Culture Council (RACC, then the Metropolitan Arts Commission).  That and subsequent RACC grants have contributed greatly to the orchestra’s development.  In 1997 and 1998 we also received a grant from the Templeton Foundation to help support our elementary school program.  Beginning in the summer of 2003 the symphony started presenting free pops concerts as part of the Oregon City Arts Faire, and also presented a three concert series in North Clackamas Park in conjunction with the Milwaukie Center.  The Oregon City Cultural Improvement Trust provided the symphony a grant to hold a commemorative concert in honor of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial in 2004.  The symphony repeated the Lewis and Clark concert at the Columbia Gorge Discover Center in the Dalles.</p>

              <p id="playerP">Carol Dumond read music in grade school from a guy with a portative organ who showed up at her school every week or so. She sang in the girls choir at church. In high school, she taught herself piano and accordion, and played trumpet and sax in the school band. Carol majored in music at USC, where her main instrument was voice. She sang in a number of choruses and did a lot of solo work in San Francisco, including clubs, cabarets, opera and stage musicals; she also got started arranging and composing music around 1986. As she got older and her high notes started going she took up viola. After moving to Portland in 2006, she tried a few orchestras, and joined WFSO in 2007. Around that time, she became a founding member of the Portland Recorder Society (she is still a member), and was also a founding member of the Recorder Orchestra of Oregon (but she had to give that up for reasons of time). This is the orchestra that Carol has kept, although she does play with Tualatin Valley and other groups from time to time. </p>

                  <p id="playerP">Bill Garbett (percussion) followed in his father’s footsteps. His father was a Big Band drummer in the 30s and 40s. When he was only three, Bill would climb on his dad’s drum set and play to the jazz and big band recordings. When he was eight, his dad enrolled him in a group drum class that met on Saturday mornings at the local elementary school. Several years later he was introduced to the symphony timpanist and thus began his studies in classical percussion.</p>
                  <p id="playerP">At age 21 he was named principal percussionist of the Sacramento Symphony and Sacramento Ballet Orchestra. After two years with the Marines during the Vietnam War, Bill returned to his position with the Sacramento Symphony and his college studies in political science.</p>
                  <p id="playerP">Employment In government brought him to Portland where he had the opportunity to be the drummer for  the Thara Memory/ Greg McElvey Monday Night Big Band. After retirement, Bill wanted to return to his classical roots and joined the Willamette Fall Symphony as timpanist. He is also timpanist with the Tualatin Valley Symphony.</p>

              <p id="prosPGap">Positions available for all strings and percussion. Works to be performed include Beethoven 7, Schumann 1, and music of Lain American and women composers.</p>
    
              <p id="prosPGap">✓ No audition required, but players must have sufficient skill to play standard orchestra repertoire (including some fairly difficult music—think college level.</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">✓ 4 classical concerts each season and 1 optional summer outdoor pops concert.</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">✓ Qualified students (age 12 or older) welcome.</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">✓ No fee.</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">✓ Players are eligible to enter our own Concerto Competition.</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">✓ Small string and wind ensembles encouraged, with occasional performance opportunities for qualified groups. Large string chamber music library available to players at no charge.</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">✓ Rehearsals are on Thursdays 7:00-9:30 PM at the United Methodist Church, 18955 S. South End Rd. in Oregon City.</p>

              <p class="boardTitlesTitle">Other reasons to consider joining WFS</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">1. Financial Stability. This orchestra has been here for over 30 years and is here to stay. An enthusiastic and dedicated board has seen to it that we are in the black every year. Thanks to a dedicated and enthusiastic board and generous donations from them, our audience, and many of our players, we have been in the black every year.</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">2. Grants have allowed us to acquire a good sized music library and equipment that most community orchestras do not own, such as our own stands, timpani, and a wonderful new bass drum.</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">3. We are one of the best community orchestras in the area and play great music. Some of it (such as the Firebird) is considerably more difficult than what most community orchestras will tackle so at times we have to struggle to meet the challenge, but we always manage to do it, much to our delight!</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">4. We are a friendly and fun group (including our conductor, Mark Perlman). This is not a cut throat competitive orchestra, but a helpful encouraging one. Strings are not necessarily arranged according to ability. All players can demonstrate their proficiency to all if they wish by entering our player concerto competition held every 2 years. Our success as an orchestra is in large part due to a great deal of player participation in the running of the orchestra. Players are represented on the board along with community members and are heavily involved in the details of running the orchestra. In addition, occasional player surveys allow players to express their opinions to the conductor and the board.</p>
              <p id="prosPGap">5. We have a stable, enthusiastic audience that normally pretty well fills seats at concerts, and our summer outdoor pops attracts about 1000 people.</p>
